<p>1. <b>User:</b>This is you, sitting on a computer right now.<br>

   2. <b> Computer:</b> This is the machine you will use that would be having a browser (<em>e.g</em> Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari etc.).<br>

   3. <b>Internet:</b> This is the actual structure that will direct the request path to the actual destination.<br>

   4. <b>Server:</b> This is a computer known as server that only serve information requested by the user.<br><br>
